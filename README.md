## Update Log July 29, 2025 (Authorization Code System & Configurable API Endpoints!)

We are excited to announce two significant updates that enhance both usability and flexibility:

### üîë New Authorization Code System
![licenseCode.png](licenseCode.png)

### Cloud service platform access address: https://modelkey.cn

**What's New:**
- ‚úì Cloud-based authorization code generation for encrypted models and workflows
- ‚úì One-click distribution of authorization codes to users
- ‚úì Automatic machine binding on first verification
- ‚úì No more manual machine code exchanges!

**How It Works:**
1. **For Creators:**
   - Generate authorization codes in the cloud platform for your encrypted models/workflows
   - Share these codes with your authorized users
   - No need to manually collect and bind machine codes anymore!

2. **For Users:**
   - Simply enter the authorization code in the `license_code` field of any decryption node
   - On first verification, your machine is automatically bound to that model/workflow
   - Access all authorized content immediately without sending machine codes to creators

**Supported Nodes:**
- All encrypted model decryption nodes (`LmcqAuthModelDecryption`)
- All encrypted LoRA decryption nodes (`LmcqAuthLoraDecryption`)
- All encrypted workflow nodes (`LmcqAuthWorkflowDecryption`)
- All encrypted group nodes (`LmcqGroupNodes`)

**Benefits:**
- üì± **Simplified Authorization**: No more complex machine code exchanges
- üîÑ **Self-Service Binding**: Users can self-authorize with valid codes
- üõ°Ô∏è **Enhanced Security**: Each code can have usage limitations and expiration dates
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time-Saving**: Instantly distribute authorization to multiple users

### üåê Configurable API Endpoints

**New Feature:**
- ‚úì Configurable API endpoint URLs in `auth_key.json`
- ‚úì Support for private cloud deployments
- ‚úì Default fallback to public servers if not configured

**How to Configure:**
Simply add a `base_url` parameter in your `auth_key.json` file:
```json
{
    "auth_key": "YOUR_AUTH_KEY",
    "auth_secret": "YOUR_AUTH_SECRET",
    "base_url": "http://your.custom.server:port/api/v1"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- üè¢ **Private Deployments**: Deploy your own authorization server for enhanced control
- üîí **Enhanced Privacy**: Keep all authorization traffic within your own network
- üåç **Global Flexibility**: Configure regional servers for improved performance
- üîÑ **Seamless Fallback**: If no custom URL is provided, the system automatically uses the default public server

This update dramatically improves the user experience for both content creators and end-users by eliminating the cumbersome process of manually exchanging machine codes, while also providing the flexibility to use custom authorization servers!

## Introduction

ComfyUI small node toolkit, this toolkit is mainly to update some practical small nodes, to make a contribution to the comfyui ecosystem,
PS: "LMCQ" is the abbreviation of the team name

## Update Log June 1, 2025 (Fixed the Wire Disconnection Issue After Encryption!)

This update solves the two most reported problems from users: lost connections after encryption and infinite loop errors!

### üîß Fixed Wire Disconnection After Encryption(Only for versions before eba7a25, input port will be lost after that, and manual connection is still required)
![version.png](version.png)
Users used to frequently encounter these problems:
- Selected several nodes for encryption, only to find all wires disconnected after encryption
- Had to manually reconnect all the wires, which was very troublesome  
- Sometimes incorrect connections caused workflows to fail

**Now it's completely fixed!** All connections are automatically maintained after encryption, no manual reconnection needed.

### üõ°Ô∏è Smart Detection to Avoid Infinite Loop Errors
Previously, when users selected nodes for encryption, they might accidentally create infinite loops, causing:
- "Loop Detected" errors during execution
- Workflows getting stuck and unable to run
- Not knowing what went wrong

**Now the system automatically detects this!** For example:
- You select "CLIP Text Encoder" and "K Sampler" to encrypt together
- But there's a "ControlNet" node in between that wasn't selected
- The system will warn you: "‚ùå Would create infinite loop, please encrypt separately"

### üìù Simple Solutions
When the system warns of a problem, you can:
1. **Encrypt Separately**: Encrypt "CLIP Text Encoder" and "K Sampler" individually
2. **Select All**: Choose "CLIP Text Encoder", "ControlNet", and "K Sampler" together for encryption
3. **Reselect**: Choose other node combinations that won't cause problems

### üîê New Password Persistence Feature
This is the long-awaited feature! Now you don't have to worry about re-entering passwords after browser refresh:

- **üîÑ Auto Save & Restore**: Passwords are automatically saved to browser's local storage when entered in encryption nodes
- **üåê Refresh-Proof**: After browser refresh, all created encryption nodes will automatically restore their previously entered passwords
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security Protection**: Passwords are only saved locally in browser, not written to workflow files, ensuring no password leakage when sharing workflows
- **üßπ Smart Cleanup**: Passwords are automatically cleaned when nodes are deleted; system periodically cleans invalid password data
- **üõ†Ô∏è Manual Cleanup**: If you need to clear all passwords, enter `window.clearLmcqPasswords()` in browser console

### üéâ Much Easier to Use Now
- Right-click menu directly shows whether encryption is possible, no need to worry about wrong selections
- If there's a problem with your selection, the menu will be grayed out with a reason
- No more wire disconnection or infinite loop issues after encryption
- **Enter password once, remember forever!** No need to repeatedly enter passwords for multiple encryption nodes in complex workflows

In short, the encrypted node group feature is now more stable and user-friendly!

## Update Log May 8, 2025 (Encrypted Node Groups & Enhanced Security Core!)

We are excited to announce two major advancements in ComfyUI-LMCQ, focusing on enhanced functionality and core security:

### 1. Encrypted Node Group Functionality (Cloud Secured)

Introducing the **LmcqGroupNode**! This powerful new node allows you to encapsulate a group of nodes (a subgraph) into a single, securely encrypted unit, managed via our cloud platform.

![group_node_protection_placeholder.png](group_node_protection_placeholder.png) <!-- TODO: Add a relevant screenshot for group node functionality -->

**Key Features**:
- **Protect Complex Workflows**: Securely package intricate node combinations or proprietary logic into a single, encrypted block.
- **Cloud-Based Security**: Encryption keys and authorizations are managed through our secure cloud API, ensuring only verified users can access the internal subgraph.
- **User-Friendly Operation**: Once authorized, the encrypted group functions like a standard ComfyUI node group, with its internal complexity remaining protected.
- **Secure Access**: Utilizes a user-defined `workflow_identifier` and `password` for authentication with the cloud service to enable decryption.
- **Optional Machine Binding**: For an added layer of security, node groups can be bound to specific machine codes, aligning with the protection offered by other Lmcq authenticated nodes.

**How It Works (Conceptual)**:
1. A subgraph designed in ComfyUI is prepared for encryption.
2. This subgraph, along with a chosen password, a unique identifier, and optional machine codes, is registered with the Lmcq cloud service.
3. The service provides an encrypted representation of the subgraph.
4. In ComfyUI, the `LmcqGroupNode` uses this encrypted data, the identifier, and password to request decryption from the cloud service upon execution.
5. If successfully authenticated and authorized, the subgraph is decrypted in memory and functions as intended.

This feature empowers creators to share advanced functionalities or pre-configured setups with enhanced control and security, preventing direct exposure of the internal workflow logic.

### 2. Enhanced Core Security through Advanced Compilation

ComfyUI-LMCQ's core runtime modules now benefit from a significant security upgrade. We have transitioned to an **advanced compilation technique** that transforms our Python source code into a more secure, binary format.

**Key Improvements**:
- **Greatly Increased Source Code Protection**: The new compiled format is substantially more resistant to reverse-engineering and decompilation compared to previous protection methods. This robustly safeguards the intellectual property embedded in our core logic.
- **Enhanced Plugin Integrity**: This security enhancement contributes to a more secure and trustworthy plugin for all users.
- **Optimized Distribution**: The distributable version of the plugin now includes these securely compiled modules, ensuring that the protected code is what end-users receive.

This fundamental improvement in how we protect our codebase ensures that ComfyUI-LMCQ continues to offer innovative features with a strong emphasis on security and intellectual property protection. End-users will experience these benefits through a more secure plugin environment.

## Update Log 2025-04-23 (Code Protection Node!)

Introducing the new Code Protection nodes designed to encrypt your Python source code files for ComfyUI custom nodes:

![code_protection.png](code_protection.png) <!-- Placeholder: Add screenshot later -->

### Code Protection Nodes
- **LmcqCodeEncryption**: Encrypts a `.py` file, generating a `.pye` encrypted file and an optional loader stub (`.py`).
- **LmcqCodeDecryptionLoader**: Loads and executes the encrypted `.pye` file using the loader stub.

### Key Features
- **Protect Your Logic**: Encrypt your custom node's source code to prevent easy reverse engineering or unauthorized modification.
- **Encryption Levels**: Choose between "Basic", "Advanced", and "Supreme" encryption levels for varying degrees of security.
- **Optional Obfuscation**: Apply simple variable name obfuscation for an extra layer of protection (Note: May impact complex code, use with caution).
- **Custom Import Hook**: Generates a loader stub (`.py` file with the original name) that automatically handles the decryption and loading process when the module is imported.
- **Keep Original Option**: Decide whether to keep the original `.py` file after encryption.

### How It Works
1. Use `LmcqCodeEncryption` to select your `.py` file, choose an encryption level, and optionally enable obfuscation and loader stub generation.
2. The node outputs an encrypted `.pye` file and potentially overwrites the original `.py` with a loader stub (if `add_custom_import_hook` is True and `keep_original` is False).
3. When Python imports the loader stub `.py` file, it automatically finds the corresponding `.pye` file, decrypts it using the embedded key, and executes the code in memory.

This system allows you to distribute your custom nodes in a protected format while maintaining ease of use for end-users.

## Update Log 2025-03-04 (Authentication Server Encryption System!)

## Update Log 2025-01-08 (White-box Encryption & Enhanced Security!)

We have implemented a sophisticated white-box encryption system and enhanced our security mechanisms:

### White-box Encryption
- Dynamic T-box and S-box generation
- Complex key expansion algorithm
- Multiple round transformations
- Memory protection mechanism

### Enhanced Security Features
- ‚úì Secure key storage
- ‚úì Anti-debugging protection
- ‚úì Memory tampering detection
- ‚úì Runtime integrity verification

The new white-box encryption implementation makes it extremely difficult to extract encryption keys even with full access to the code. Combined with our existing multi-layer protection scheme, this provides state-of-the-art security for your models and workflows.

## Update log 2024-12-29 (Introducing a multi-layer protection mechanism in the core code of the runtime protection system package!)
Because the encryption and decryption node code of the previous version was displayed in plain text, it was easy for reverse engineers to crack it, thus failing to ensure the security of the model. Now the core encryption and decryption code uniformly introduces a multi-layer protection mechanism

- Multi-layer protection scheme
   - AST-level code obfuscation
   - PyArmor basic encryption
   - Variable name/function name obfuscation
   - Interference code injection
   - String obfuscation

Now all the security node codes in the project are highly encrypted with a multi-layer protection scheme, which greatly increases the difficulty of cracking by reverse engineers, thereby ensuring the security of the model.
